## Whale Core

Whale is a LuaJIT machine learning library. Currently the features are very limited and are build as I follow Coursera's Machine Learning course [https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/).

## What's included

Very basic ML algorithms:
- Linear regression
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks

## Notice

The entire library is experimental. 
An Editor (whale-editor) is being developed to facilate the development using Whale. 

## Motives

:+1: Lua is so easy, high level and has a clean .. unless metatables are involved .. nah just kidding.

:+1: Lua is can easily interface with C/C++, you have access to APIs like OpenCV, Qt, etc from a very simple language.

:+1: LuaJIT makes Lua run much faster and it becomes comparable to native code.
